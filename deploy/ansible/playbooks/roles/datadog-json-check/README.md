# json_check

A custom datadog-agent check that gets a json response from a given URL, and extracts a specific metric from it based on a given json path

## Installation

To use the json_check check, you will need to install the "jsonpath-rw" package
Remember the datadog-agent uses his own copy of python and pip so use them

```bash
/opt/datadog-agent/embedded/bin/pip install jsonpath-rw
```

## Configuration

Edit the json_check.yaml file to configure the check

* `default_timout`: How long to wait for the GET request to complete
* `url`: The URL to send the request to
* `metrics`: The name of the metric to send, and the json path it should be in. [Syntax for json path](https://github.com/kennknowles/python-jsonpath-rw#jsonpath-syntax)

## Events

The check will send events in case of a failure

* "request timeout" - in the event of a timeout
* "Invalid status code for URL" - for any status code other than 200
* "no matching value" - when no value was found for the given json path
* "unexpected match" - when the value found is not a number

## Example

Get the price of BTC and ETH
```yaml
init_config:
  default_timeout: 5

instances:
  - url: https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v2/ticker
    metrics:
      # numeric key names should be in double quotes, otherwise they will be considered as an array index
      - usd.price:
          path: data."1".quotes.USD.price
          type: gauge  # values can be: gauge, count, rate
      - eth.price:
          path: '[data]["1027"][quotes][USD][price]'
          type: gauge
```
