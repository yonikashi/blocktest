# Horizon SSE Performance Improvement Test App

This is a test application designed to test an SSE performacne improvement feature added to horizon.

In this test, we create multiple accounts, and listen for SSE stream events arriving to each account
while sending transactions from one account to another, in bulks.

This tests SSE functionality is correct.
